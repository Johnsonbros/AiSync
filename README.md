# AiSync

AiSync expands the capabilities of Housecall Pro by allowing service-based businesses such as plumbing and electrical companies to create custom AI-driven agents. These agents are designed to help manage scheduling, dispatching, and other operational tasks so business owners can focus on providing great service.

## Project Overview

This project aims to provide tooling and examples for integrating AI agents with Housecall Pro. The goal is to make it easier for businesses to automate routine workflow steps, gather insights from customer data, and streamline communication.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies (to be determined as the project develops).
3. Configure your Housecall Pro API credentials and any other required settings.

## Usage

Detailed usage instructions will be added once the project includes code examples. In general, the intent is to run these agents locally or in the cloud, where they can access your Housecall Pro account to automate tasks like scheduling service calls or following up with customers.
